## Goals 🎯
* Get weather data for a list of destinations and determine the top 10 best destinations 
* Get hotels' info about top 10 destinations
* Store all the information above in a data lake
* Extract, transform and load cleaned data from your datalake to a data warehouse

## Deliverable 📬
* The map of the 10 destinations according to weather conditions (lowest precipitation and highest temperature) is available in the notebook in the folder "Get weather data". You can zoom in and zoom out.
* The map of the 10 destinations with hotels' information is available in the notebook in the folder "Get hotel data". You can zoom in and zoom out.
* The csv file is vailable in the folder "S3 and AWS RDS". Note that the AWS account has been desactivated (keys are not working anymore), DO NOT RUN the code it won't work.
