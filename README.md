## Goals ðŸŽ¯

As the project has just started, your team doesn't have any data that can be used to create this application. Therefore, your job will be to: 

* Scrape data from destinations 
* Get weather data from each destination 
* Get hotels' info about each destination
* Store all the information above in a data lake
* Extract, transform and load cleaned data from your datalake to a data warehouse

## Deliverable ðŸ“¬

To complete this project, your team should deliver:

* A `.csv` file in an S3 bucket containing enriched information about weather and hotels for each french city

* A SQL Database where we should be able to get the same cleaned data from S3 

* Two maps where you should have a Top-10 destinations and a Top-20 hotels in the area.
